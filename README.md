# Compile  
Use the Makefile to compile, make sure you have the ncurses library before you compile it.

# Map  
There is savefile.dat templating what custom maps look like. The user can create their own maps and by editing string filename in the controls.cpp can gain access to their custom maps.

# Guide  
The player starts the game and can quit anytime by pressing the q key. The user will lose the game if the hero's energy goes below 0. The user will win if he finds one royal diamond tile. The player can move as displayed by the menu with 1,2,3, and 4. The user can hover over revealed tiles by using the arrow keys to move the cursor around. The player can find food and exchange whiffles for energy to live longer. The player can find tools and purchase them to reduce the energy consumption of an obstacle. Obstacles once encountered must be removed. There is a cheat system implemented that displays the whole screen with keypress ‘r’ and keypress ‘+’ gives 1000 energy to the user. 

# Features

Allows the user to buy tools that can be spent on reducing energy consumption in removal of obstacles. Allows the user to traverse water tiles by purchasing a ship that disembarks when on land.
